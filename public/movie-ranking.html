<h3>Hidden Figures</h3>
<p>Hidden Figures is a 2016 American biographical drama film directed by Theodore Melfi and written by Melfi and Allison Schroeder. 
    It is loosely based on the 2016 non-fiction book of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly about three female African-American mathematicians:
     Katherine Goble Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe), who worked at NASA

    Produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Mandeville Films,[1][6] it is a live-action/CGI remake of Disney's 1991 animated feature film of the same name, 
    itself an adaptation of Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont's 1756 version of the fairy tale.</p>

<p>The movie is about a man who changed into a beast in appearance because of his rude behaviour.</p>
<h4>Below is my favourite poem from the movie</h4>

A Merchant, who by generous pains  <br/>
Prospered in honourable gains, <br/>
Could boast, his wealth and fame to share, <br/>
Three manly Sons, three Daughters fair; <br/>
With these he felt supremely blest.— <br/>
His latest born surpass'd the rest: <br/>
She was so gentle, good and kind, <br/>
So fair in feature, form, and mind, <br/>
So constant too in filial duty, <br/>
The neighbours called her Little Beauty! <br/>
And when fair childhood's days were run, <br/>
That title still she wore and won; <br/>
Lovelier as older still she grew, <br/>
Improv'd in grace and goodness too.— <br/>
Her elder Sisters, gay and vain, <br/>
View'd her with envy and disdain, <br/>
Toss'd up their heads with haughty air; <br/>
Dress, Fashion, Pleasure, all their care. <br/>
